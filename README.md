# CareCapsule - A Perscription Management App (Capstone-2025)
Our project, named **CareCapsule**, is a mobile app designed for managing medications by keeping track of and explaining a patient's prescriptions safely.  

The app lets users scan their prescription labels or barcodes and change drug codes, like UPC, EAN, or NDC, into standard drug identifiers known as **RxNorm**. It then uses protected data from secure sources such as **DailyMed**, **MedlinePlus**, and the **FDA**.  

The system warns users about possible drug interactions and repeated doses while offering easy-to-understand messages on dosage instructions, proper usage, and potential side effects. Additionally, it logs medication usage and includes reminders to help users take their medication on time.  

This app is built to work across platforms using **Kotlin Multiplatform** (for both iOS and Android), with a **Python backend** and **SQL database** for secure data storage.
